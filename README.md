# Sean Michael Casey | Systems Architect for the Third Sector

### **A Portfolio of Practical Solutions**

Hello! The case studies in this portfolio are designed for a non-technical audience, specifically leaders and managers in the charity sector.

My professional work involves building data systems for organisations with sensitive information. Because that work is confidential, I have created these practical demonstrations to showcase my working methods in a safe and open environment.

These projects use a non-confidential dataset (from a role-playing game) to demonstrate how I solve common, real-world problems that many charities face. Each case study is a blueprint for building more efficient, reliable, and impactful data systems.

### **Featured Case Studies**

### [1. Turning Messy Spreadsheets into a Usable Database](https://github.com/seancasey-portfolio/Case-Study-Cleaning-Legacy-Data)
*   **Problem:** Your organisation has years of valuable data scattered across different, inconsistent spreadsheets and legacy systems.
*   **Solution:** This case study outlines a reliable, step-by-step process for automatically cleaning, structuring, and migrating this chaotic data into a single, trustworthy, and easy-to-use central database.

### [2. Automating Internal Reports & Documentation](https://github.com/seancasey-portfolio/Case-Study-Automating-Internal-Documentation)
*   **Problem:** Staff spend too much time writing up meeting notes, summarising long documents, and trying to find critical information.
*   **Solution:** This project demonstrates a simple, automated workflow that can read messy transcripts and create clean, structured summaries, helping you build a searchable knowledge base and preserve your team's institutional memory.

### [3. Building Reliable & Well-Behaved AI Tools](https://github.com/seancasey-portfolio/Case-Study-Building-Reliable-AI-Tools)
*   **Problem:** You want to use modern AI tools but are concerned about accuracy, reliability, and the risk of unpredictable outputs.
*   **Solution:** This document outlines a practical "quality control" framework for AI. It demonstrates a mandatory, three-step internal checklist that ensures an AI tool's work is complete and accurate before it produces a final output.

### [4. Transforming Raw Data into Compelling Stories](https://github.com/seancasey-portfolio/Case-Study-Data-To-Impact-Stories)
*   **Problem:** You have the statistics that prove your impact, but struggle to turn them into the powerful, human stories needed for fundraising appeals and impact reports.
*   **Solution:** This case study shows a method for using a supervised AI tool to act as an "interpretation layer"â€”intelligently reframing raw data into a compelling narrative that highlights the human element of your work.
